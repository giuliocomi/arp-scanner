# arp-scanner
A simple and lightweight C# ARP scanner to identify live hosts in your LAN. 
The ARP scanner has been originally develop as a very portable Powershell script [ActiveARP.ps1](https://github.com/giuliocomi/posh-discovery/blob/master/cmdlets/ActiveARP.ps1).

This standalone solution might be useful for quickly discover hosts in the subnet when ICMP requests are filtered by the live hosts.

## Features
1) Essentiality and portability
2) Discover live hosts on your LAN despite of filtered ICMP packets 
3) Identify the manufacturer details of the interface by resolving the MAC

## Notes
The [maclist.txt](https://github.com/giuliocomi/arp-scanner/blob/master/maclist.txt) file must be downloaded to be able to resolve the MAC.
The input file with the target IP addresses can be easily generated with the Powershell script [CalculateRange.ps1](https://github.com/giuliocomi/posh-discovery/blob/master/cmdlets/CalculateRange.ps1).
A timeout (in ms) can be set through command line.
